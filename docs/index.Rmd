## Covid Report
Based off the data analysis, the total number of COVID cases in the US is `r get_total_cases()`. The total number of US deaths is `r get_total_deaths()`. As
we can see in the chart below, the number of cases has steadily increased over
the time period. The highest rate of increase was at the beginning of 2022.

This is a chart that shows the cumulative number of COVID cases in the US over
the last 3ish years:
